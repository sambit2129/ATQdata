# ATQ: Latitude and Longitude Analysis of Countries  

ATQ (All Terrain Query) is a Data Science project focused on analyzing the latitude and longitude of countries worldwide. It provides insightful geospatial analysis, enabling researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts to explore geographic patterns, relationships, and trends using country-level geolocation data.

---

## Project Overview  

ATQ leverages data science techniques to analyze and visualize latitude and longitude coordinates of countries. It aims to provide meaningful insights into:
- Geospatial distributions and clusters
- Distance calculations and proximity analysis
- Regional and continental trends
- Geopolitical and demographic correlations

---

## Features  

- **Comprehensive Geolocation Dataset:** Accurate latitude and longitude data for all recognized countries.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Powerful tools to analyze geographic patterns and visualize data on interactive maps.
- **Statistical Insights:** Perform statistical analysis to explore relationships between geolocation and other socio-economic variables.
- **Custom Queries and Filtering:** Filter data by continent, region, or specific countries.
- **Exportable Reports:** Generate and export analysis reports in various formats (CSV, PDF, and Excel).

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project includes:
- Country name
- Latitude and Longitude coordinates
- Continent and region classification  
- Additional socio-economic indicators (optional)

Data sources include reliable geospatial databases and international organizations to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Data Analysis Workflow  

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**  
   - Load geolocation data using Pandas.  
   - Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Statistical summary of latitude and longitude distributions.  
   - Visualization of geospatial clusters and patterns.  

3. **Geospatial Analysis and Mapping:**  
   - Visualize country locations on interactive maps using Folium.  
   - Cluster analysis and heatmaps to explore regional patterns.  

4. **Statistical Insights and Correlations:**  
   - Analyze correlations between geolocation and socio-economic factors.  
   - Perform hypothesis testing and regression analysis.  

5. **Reporting and Exporting Results:**  
   - Generate analysis reports in CSV, PDF, and Excel formats.  
   - Save interactive maps and visualizations as images.  

---

## Visualization Examples  

- **World Map with Country Locations:** Visualize all countries on an interactive world map using Folium.  
- **Regional Heatmap:** Highlight geospatial density and clusters by region.  
- **Scatter Plot of Latitude vs. Longitude:** Explore geographical distributions.  
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Investigate relationships between geolocation and other variables.

---

## Sample Code  

```python
import pandas as pd
import folium

# Load Data
df = pd.read_csv('data/country_lat_long.csv')

# Initialize Map
world_map = folium.Map(location=[0, 0], zoom_start=2)

# Plot Country Markers
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    folium.Marker(
        location=[row['latitude'], row['longitude']],
        popup=row['country'],
        icon=folium.Icon(color='blue')
    ).add_to(world_map)

# Display Map
world_map.save('output/world_map.html')
```

---

## Example Analysis  

- **Latitude Clusters:** Explore how countries are clustered by latitude and their impact on climate and vegetation.  
- **Longitude Patterns:** Analyze longitudinal patterns to understand time zones and economic activities.  
- **Geopolitical Insights:** Investigate how geolocation affects political borders and international relations.
